const missionStatement = `
I am a Systems Software Engineer with a Master’s in Computer Science and a 
Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering from Cal Poly SLO. My focus is on Modern C++ 
(C++20 and beyond) to write memory-safe, modular, and reliable code. My goal is 
to bring your embedded projects to life efficiently and effectively.

With a background in embedded systems, I’m passionate about adopting modern 
tools like CMake, CI/CD, linters, and Docker to accelerate development. While 
embedded systems often struggle with outdated tooling, I’ve seen firsthand in 
industries like semiconductors and robotics that implementing these tools can 
drastically improve productivity and decision-making.

I enjoy diving deep into low-level systems, from working with RISC-V softcore 
processors to building automated testing infrastructure at Siemens Healthineers 
and creating containerization platforms in Rust. I’m committed to making 
embedded development modern, efficient, and impactful.
